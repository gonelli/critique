# Deviations

- Finished implementing the Alpha features of blocking and privacy.
- Since we got a head start on the Beta features in the Alpha release, we were able to start Messaging early.

## Things to fix:

### Less difficult
- Nightnight change names and like scores to gray
- Profile picture for blocked, followers, search, etc.
- All movie search results
- No duplicates on messages list view controller

### More difficult
- Show first messages in chats without scrolling
- Fix table view crash when quickly reloading**
- No Internet Crash**

## Notes:

- Since there is now a Profile Page, you can view your own reviews there instead of the Feed, unlike the Alpha.
- You recommended we swap the positions of the Login and Create Account screens in out Alpha. We have kept them in that position because our app automatically signs users in after they create an account. Since most users won't sign out, we believe the first screen should be the Create Account, because they are likely a new user.
