# Deviations

- Our alpha submission offers nearly everything promised, aside from two of our settings; blocking and account privacy. These settings work within Firebase and only need to influence search results.
- We went ahead to some of our beta features and have implemented movie info, movie search, and critic page. All of these features work, but will continue to be refined.

## Things to fix:

- Calculate a movie's Critique score
- Populate movie info page with reviews
- Block people from finding each other in search if one person blocks
- Hide private accounts
- Order feed by date posted
- Cap movie scores
- Don't show yourself in your followers/following
- Followers cells should segue to the right account


## Things to add:

- Messaging users has not yet been implemented
- Likes and dislikes on reviews
