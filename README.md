# Deviations

- Finished implementing the Alpha features of blocking and privacy.
- Since we got a head start on the Beta features in the Alpha release, we were able to start Messaging early.

## Things to fix:

- ~~Sign up and Login screen orders~~
- ~~Segue from expanded review to profile~~
- ~~Add own reviews to Feed~~
- ~~Night mode for Discovery~~
- Sign up sign in dark mode
- (difficult) Poster bug on bottom of account table
- Fix table view crash when quickly reloading**
- No Internet Crash**
- Clean up sign in / create account views and dismissals
- Time when you block someone in the chat table
- Deleting chats
 - (optional) initials for blocked, followers, search, etc.


## Notes:

- Since there is now a Profile Page, you can view your own reviews there instead of the Feed, unlike the Alpha.
- You recommended we swap the positions of the Login and Create Account screens in out Alpha. We have kept them in that position because our app automatically signs users in after they create an account. Since most users won't sign out, we believe the first screen should be the Create Account, because they are likely a new user.
