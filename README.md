# Deviations

- Finished implementing the Alpha features of blocking and privacy.
- Since we got a head start on the Beta features in the Alpha release, we were able to start Messaging early.
- The like/dislike backend is functional, however the front end has known bugs.

## Things to fix:

- Messaging is very much a work in progress and is known to frequently crash the app
- Like/dislike updates the score correctly in the backend, however the buttons are sometimes incorrectly updated.

## Things to add:

- Messaging
- Discovery (Stretch goal)
- IMDB Links (Stretch goal)
